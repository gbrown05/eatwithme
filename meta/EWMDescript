Eat With Me Product Description

Eat With Me, a mobile application, lets users find friends who are available to 
eat. Users can select contacts in their phone with whom they would be 
interested in eating. When the user wants to get a meal, they select where they 
would be interested in eating (different dining halls and other food options).

Eat With Me is used when the user is ready to eat.  After opening the app, the 
user sees a giant button that says "Let's Eat!". When the user presses, this
button, there are three main screens: "Who's Available?," "Messages," and 
"Private Chat."

The user can select one or more people to chat with from the "Who's Available?"
screen, based on where people want to eat. It's always possible to open up more
chats with others; all of these chats can be with one other person or with 
groups.

Once a user has been inactive on Eat With Me for 15 minutes, his/her status is
automatically changed to unavailable and will no longer appear in other people's
"Who's Available?" lists.
