Prototype for Eat With Me, Comp 171, March 2014
George Brown (gbrown05) and Emily Naito (enaito01)

These files contain our medium fidelity prototype for Assignment #5.

Viewing the prototype:

All files have been pushed to a private repo on GitHub, but have also
been
publicly pushed to GitHub pages. The easiest way to view the prototype
is to go
to: http://gbrown05.github.io/eatwithme/prototype

From here, all pages except for welcome.html and joining.html are
linked.
These two special pages would only be seen the first time someone opens
the app.
To view them, go to
http://gbrown05.github.io/eatwithme/prototype/welcome.html

Alternatively, open any of the HTML files in the browser of your choice.
They
are optimized for mobile screens. Semantic functions generally do not
work, as
there is no server-side code.

There is also one CSS file (default.css) and two JavaScript files for
the basic messaging features. Some JavaScript has been recycled from code 
written in Ming Chow's Comp 20, Web Programming, Spring 2014.

All files:

avail.html
chats.html
default.css
index.html
individchat.html
joining.html
messages.js
messages2.js
sidd.html
welcome.html
where.html
